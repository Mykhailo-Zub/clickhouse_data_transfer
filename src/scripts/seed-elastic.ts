 * database. It's intended for setting up a development or testing environment with
 * realistic data.

 * @usage
 * ```

/**
 * @function main
 * @description The main entry point for the Elasticsearch seeding script.
 * @summary This function performs the following actions:
 * 1. Initializes and validates the application configuration.
 * 2. Creates an Elasticsearch client instance.
 * 3. Instantiates the `ElasticsearchUserRepository`.
 * 4. Sets up the `UserDataGenerator` and the `SeedingService`.
 * 5. Executes the seeding process based on the configured number of mock users and batch size.
 * 6. Logs progress and reports the final outcome.
 * 7. Ensures the Elasticsearch client connection is closed upon completion or error.
 *
 * @returns {Promise<void>} A promise that resolves when the script finishes.
 *
 * @responsibility
 * - To serve as the executable for populating the Elasticsearch database with test data.
 * - To orchestrate the setup of all required components for seeding.
 * - To handle the seeding workflow and provide user feedback.
